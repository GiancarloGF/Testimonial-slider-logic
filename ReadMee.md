## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox



### What I learned
In this section I've learned to use object structure to catch data from my characteres. Also, I was able to use CLAMP() in CSS to modify the font size while reduce the window, so I used on a Div that contains an background -img. 
I learned how to  use the Disabled property on an HTML element (button).



### Continued development

In this exercise, I wanted to focus on Javascript logic, for that reason I didn't focus on Responsive behavior or Mobile-First appearance. I want to focus on those concepts later.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://codepen.io/GiancarloGF24/pen/OJbdZQL) - This helped me for positioning an element over another. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Example resource 2](https://codepen.io/GiancarloGF24/pen/OJbzgBq) - This helped me for having an idea about imitating a behavior like an image gallery. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
